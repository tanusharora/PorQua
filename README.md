# PorQua â€“ Portfolio Optimization and Backtesting Framework

**PorQua** is a Python library developed under the [GeomScale](https://github.com/GeomScale) organization. It provides tools for portfolio optimization, index replication, and backtesting of investment strategies using advanced mathematical techniques and quantitative models.

This fork introduces a **robust testing framework** as part of a GSoC 2025 initiative to improve the reliability and maintainability of the codebase.

## ðŸš€ Goals of This Fork

This repository focuses on:
- Building a **structured unit test suite** using `pytest` and `unittest`
- Introducing **CI integration** via GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Expanding test coverage across key modules (e.g. constraints, optimization, data loaders)
- Adding fixtures and mocks where appropriate to simulate test environments

âœ… All tests are designed to pass independently and reliably, using official PorQua datasets and modules.
